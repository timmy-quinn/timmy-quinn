# Hi, I'm Timmy! 

My favorite thing about engineering is learning how things work at their most fundamental level. I've found the best way to do that is by getting my hands dirty, building things and tinkering with projects. So here's where I do that!
  
My most recent obsession is ergonomic/mechanical keyboards. Here's [The KeyBird](https://github.com/timmy-quinn/hid_keyboard), the keyboard for which I've written the firmware and designed the hardware.
